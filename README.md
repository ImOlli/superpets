# SuperPets

This repository contains a small paper plugin which expands vanilla minecraft by adding some
pets with superpowers.

It's a small project I worked one due to boredom. The code is super messy.

## Usage

> Warning: This plugin is only to test some fun stuff. It should not be used in a production environment.

Just tame a dog and the throw an enchanted golden apple on him.
He will then transform into a super dog. When You shift-right-click on a
super dog he will kill all enemies in a range of 100 blocks.
